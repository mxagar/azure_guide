# A Guide to Microsoft Azure: Fundamentals, Development, Data Science and Data Engineering

In this repository I collect my notes on the different services provided by Cloud Platform Microsoft Azure.

I have structured the project in the following sections:

- [`01_fundamentals/`](./01_fundamentals/): Contents for the [Exam AZ-900: Microsoft Azure Fundamentals](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/exams/az-900/)
- [`02_developer/`](./02_developer/): Contents for the [Exam AZ-204: Microsoft Azure Developer Associate](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/azure-developer/).
- [`03_data_science/`](./03_data_science/): Contents for the [Exam DP-100: Microsoft Azure Data Scientist Associate](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/azure-data-scientist).
- [`04_data_engineering/`](./04_data_engineering/): Contents for the [Exam DP-203: Microsoft Azure Data Engineering Associate](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/azure-data-engineer).

I have used several resources to create my notes; all of them are referenced in their corresponding sections.
